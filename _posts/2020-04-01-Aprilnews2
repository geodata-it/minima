### Special Enrollment Period for Medical Benefits Now Open until Friday, April 3, 2020

In response to COVID-19, Geodata IT's medical provider, Anthem BlueCross BlueShield, has opened a special enrollment period until April 3rd, 2020. 

During this special enrollment period, those of you who qualify for this medical benefit but had previously waived it during open enrollment may sign up for coverage by completing the attached form and returning it directly to One Digital, our benefits management company.  

See the March 27th email from Sharon Bennett for more details.

### April 9th Virtual Employee Happy Hour – We Need a Theme!

We want to reiterate our appreciation for each of you, particularly during these uncertain and challenging times.  Many of you are either working remotely for the first time, or have been faced with shift changes, and we recognize that the adjustment has been challenging for all.  Although physical distancing is imperative at this time, we want to ensure that we provide a virtual platform for the Geodata IT team to stay socially connected.

Please join us for our first ever virtual employee happy hour **bold text** via Zoom on Thursday, April 9th from 3:30-4:30 pm CDT **bold text**. Please send Sharon and Ana your virtual happy hour theme suggestions by Monday of next week. The mastermind of the winning theme will win a virtual prize!
